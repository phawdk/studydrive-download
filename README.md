## 🔧 Installation Instructions
<br>

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use this extension on mobile, consider using an "Extension Enabled Browser". For example [the Mises Browser](https://www.mises.site/).
<br>


### 🌐 Chrome / Edge / Brave / Chromium ...

1. Download the latest release ZIP file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download/releases/latest).
2. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`, etc.)  
   or navigate to Three Dots > `Extensions` > `Manage Extensions`  
   or Extensions Icon > `Manage Extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle in Chrome, perhaps somewhere else in other browsers).
5. **Drag and drop the ZIP file** directly onto the extensions page,  
   or click **“Load unpacked”** and select the downloaded and extracted zip file/folder (`StudydriveDownload-phawdk-chrome-[version]`).
  
<br>
<br>

### 🦊 Firefox

1. Click on the latest release XPI file from the [Releases page](../../releases/latest).
2. This should trigger a pop-up in Firefox (top right) asking you to allow github.com to install the extension.
3. Click **“Continue to Installation”** to install the extension, then **“Add”**.

If you don't see the pop-up:
- Download the XPI file to your computer.
- Open Firefox and go to `about:addons`.
- Click on the gear icon and select **“Install Add-on From File...”**.
- Select the downloaded XPI file to install it.
