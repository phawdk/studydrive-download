## 🔧 Installation Instructions

### 🧭 Chrome / Edge / Brave / Chromium

1. Download the latest release ZIP file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download/releases/latest).
2. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`, etc.)  
   or navigate to Three Dots > `Extensions` > `Manage Extensions`  
   or Extensions Icon > `Manage Extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle in Chrome, perhaps somewhere else in other browsers).
5. **Drag and drop the ZIP file** directly onto the extensions page,  
   or click **“Load unpacked”** and select the downloaded zip file (`StudydriveDownload-phawdk-chrome-[version].zip`).


✔️ The extension will be installed and ready to use.

**🚨 Important Update on Installation Process! 🚨**  
The installation process has changed. Users now need to download the ZIP file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download/releases/latest) instead of downloading the entire repository. If you attempt to load the extension without following this new method, you may encounter the error: **"Manifest file is missing or unreadable."**


### 🦊 Firefox

1. Download the latest release ZIP file from the [Releases page](../../releases/latest).
2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **"Load Temporary Add-on"** and select the `StudydriveDownload-phawdk-[version].zip` file.

⚠️ Firefox will unload the extension when the browser is closed.
