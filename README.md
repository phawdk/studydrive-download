## 🔧 Installation Instructions

### 🧭 Chrome / Edge / Brave / Chromium

1. Download the latest release ZIP file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download/releases/latest).
2. Open your browser and go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`, etc.)  
   or navigate to Three Dots > `Extensions` > `Manage Extensions`  
   or Extensions Icon > `Manage Extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle in Chrome, perhaps somewhere else in other browsers).
5. **Drag and drop the ZIP file** directly onto the extensions page,  
   or click **“Load unpacked”** and select the downloaded zip file (`StudydriveDownload-phawdk-[version].zip`).


✔️ The extension will be installed and ready to use.

**🚨 Important Update on Installation Process! 🚨**  
The installation process has changed. Users now need to download the ZIP file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download/releases/latest) instead of downloading the entire repository. If you attempt to load the extension without following this new method, you may encounter the error: **"Manifest file is missing or unreadable."**

### 🦊 Firefox

Firefox Support is currently suspended. Note that even if I would add it again, its very user unfriendly to use as debug extensions are unloaded when you close firefox. If you are interested in Firefox support, please let me know. Let's use this issue here: [#19](https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download/issues/19)
